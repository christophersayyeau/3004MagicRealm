WorkPlan
Chris will finish combat, make it multiround, restingstuff, drops.
Ryan will finish GUI.
Stefan will finish networking.
Once a group member is finished he will pick the next thing from this list that needs doing.

Step 0 and 1 should have been done by now.
Networking needs to be added. Lots of TODOs.

Step 2
Searching and Treasure stuff needs to be fixed.
Text on left side of GUI showing what is going on.
Combat needs resting implications and drops finished.

CLOAK OF MIST:  This card allows its owner to record an extra phase to do the Hide activity.
MAGIC SPECTACLES:  This card allows its owner to record an extra phase to do the Search activity.
NOTE: whoever figures these items out needs to do the same for the specials of characters.
Victory Points.

All of above steps must be finished BEFORE april. We will need time to create the text documents.

Step 3-4
Create text documents needed.
Finish other steps first.
