# 3004MagicRealm

Step 0 and 1 should be done by now.
GUI still has lots of TODOs and needs the missing objects added.
Networking needs to be added.
THe simplest form of combat needs to be handled.

Step 2
Searching and Treasure stuff needs to be fixed.
Text on left side of GUI showing what is going on.
Combat needs multiround, resting implications finished, dead characters dropping stuff.
Cloak of Mist, magic Spectacles.
Victory Points.

Step 3
Finish other steps first.

Step 4
If you have time to work on this:  STOP and create the text documents needed instead.

We will use this to post messages to each other while we construct the project.
