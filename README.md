WorkPlan
Chris will work on search table.
Ryan will finish GUI.
Stefan will finish networking.
Once a group member is finished he will pick the next thing from this list that needs doing.

Step 0 and 1
Networking needs to be added. Lots of TODOs.

Step 2
Searching stuff needs to be finished.
Text on left side of GUI showing what is going on.

CLOAK OF MIST:  This card allows its owner to record an extra phase to do the Hide activity.
MAGIC SPECTACLES:  This card allows its owner to record an extra phase to do the Search activity.
NOTE: whoever figures these items out needs to do the same for the specials of characters.
Victory Points.

All of above steps must be finished BEFORE april. We will need time to create the text documents.

Step 3-4
Create text documents needed.
Finish other steps first.
